Make forrestry on your farm more enjoyable and cost effective, by taking control of the amount of time it takes each species of tree to fully grow to maturity.
TGM gives you the ability to change the relative growth rate of a particular tree species from 100% down to 5% - or even up to 200% if you so desire.

TGM extends the built-in game settings menu, where you'll find a new section with the relative growth rates. In a multiplayer setting, this also means that the settings are restricted to admins.
