Make forrestry on your farm more enjoyable and cost effective, by taking control of the amount of time it takes each species of tree to fully grow to maturity.
TGM gives you the ability to change the growth rate of a particular tree species from 100% up to 195% - or even down to 5% if you so desire.

TGM provides a custom settings menu, which can be accessed by the default keybind of LEFT ALT + 1. In a multiplayer setting, this menu will only be accessible by admins.

If you'd like to report a bug with this mod or would like to translate the mod into your own language, head on over to our <a href="https://github.com/Beaver-Bois-Modding/fs22-tgm">GitHub repository</a>.

Changelog 1.1.0.0:
- Implemented a custom settings menu, instead of extending the built-in game settings menu
- Fixed issues navigating the settings with a controller
- Fixed tree names not being loaded correctly for non-base maps (e.g. Silverrun Forest from the Platinum Expansion)
- Switched the axis of the growth rates to make it more intuitive (e.g. 105% is now faster and 95% is now slower, instead of the other way around)
- Implemented grouping of growth rates for variations of the same tree type
